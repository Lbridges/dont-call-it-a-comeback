Reacquainting myself with git
### 08/22/2019
I just decided to use this repo to organize notes from the last 3 months.   

The main class is "Secure & Private AI" on Udacity. Also, I am including notes from other classes across a handful of platforms covering related material.  
_My hope is to create some low level animations (gifs if necessary) to illustrate some of these concepts._  

This Readme will have to serve as a basic outline for those notes
